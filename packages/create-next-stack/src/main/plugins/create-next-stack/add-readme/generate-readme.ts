    ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, your project was successfully generated with [Create Next Stack](https://www.create-next-stack.com/)!

    To get started, run:

    \`\`\`bash
    ${runCommand} dev
    \`\`\`

    ${
      todos.length > 0
        ? endent`
            ## Final Steps

            There are a few final steps that we were not able to perform automatically. We have provided a complete list for you below. You should take care of these before you can start developing your project. You can delete each item from the list as you go along.

            ### To do:
            
            ${todos.map((todo) => `- ${todo}`).join("\n")}
          `
        : ""
    }

      scriptTableRows != null
        ? endent`
          ## Scripts

          The table below provides names and descriptions of the npm scripts available in this project.

          Each script is run using \`${runCommand} <script-name>\`. For example: \`${runCommand} dev\`.

          | Name | Description |
          | ---- | ----------- |
          ${scriptTableRows}
        `
        : ""
    }

    ${
      environmentVariableTableRows != null
        ? endent`
          ## Environment Variables
